# Overview

This is day 69 assignment.  The goal is to add users to an existing blog website.

The instructions tell us to take people directly from a successful registration to the home page as logged on.  In my example, I don't and instead direct the user from register to a login page.

Of all the lessons, I stopped this one early because it was time for me to move on from the blog website.  See the solution folder for the final answer.
NOTE: This is the first (and only) lesson I have stopped early.  I don't expect to stop others.
