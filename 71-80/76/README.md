_From the course:_

In this module, we will compare thousands of apps in the Google Play Store so that we can gain insight into:

- How competitive different app categories (e.g., Games, Lifestyle, Weather) are
- Which app category offers compelling opportunities based on its popularity
- How many downloads you would give up by making your app paid vs. free
- How much you can reasonably charge for a paid app
- Which paid apps have had the highest revenue
- How many paid apps will recoup their development costs based on their sales revenue

Today you'll learn:

- How to quickly remove duplicates
- How to remove unwanted symbols and convert data into a numeric format
- How to wrangle columns containing nested data with Pandas
- How to create compelling data visualisations with the plotly library
- Create vertical, horizontal and grouped bar charts
- Create pie and donut charts for categorical data
- Use colour scales to make beautiful scatter plots
