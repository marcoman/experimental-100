# Overview

This is the day 72 assignment.  The session is about Data Science.  The recommendation is to start with Google Collaboratory, but that has since moved to Google Colab.  That is where I am running my code.

This makes me think I could also create a jupyter notebook to run code locally.

I used a local Jupyter notebook in the `start` directory

# Running

I ran with VS Code with the Jupyter extension enabled.
