# Introduction

This is a continuation of using Sheetly + Google Sheets.
Here we will query against flight prices to find the lowest price.

As an asisde, I'll be using a separate sheet within the worksheet for this testing.  This lets me direct results to common file.

The files all reside in the flight-deals-start folder, which is a template provided to us.
