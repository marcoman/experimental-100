# Overview

This is the day 92 assignment.

## _From the course:_
A website that finds the most common colours in an uploaded image.



## My comments:

To me this sounds like a linear operation:

- Open a file
  - Read the file
- For each pixel, identify the color
- Build a list for each of the colors (sounds like a map)
- Sort the map from smallest count to largest.
- Produce the results.
