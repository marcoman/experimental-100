Using Python Turtle, build the classic shoot 'em up game - space invaders game.

Space Invaders Wikipedia Page

Your space ship can move left and right and it can hit some alien ships. Every second the aliens will move closer to your ship. Once the aliens touch your ship then it's game over. There are usually some barriers between you and the aliens which offers you defensive positions.

You can play the game here:

## My comments:

Feels like a turtle game (yes)
Also, I'll borrow from the blocks game and define a grid of space invaders such as 5 rows of 10 columns with ample spacing.
I'll have my blaster at the bottom, and it shoots as long as there isn't a sprite still on screen.
The sprite shoots straight up until it misses or hits something.
If it hits an invader, then the invader disappears and we continue.
Periodically, the invaders all advance to the left or right, depending on whether they reached the end of the wall.
When they reach the end of the wall, they drop one level, change directions, and speed up by 1.
