Build a custom website using an API that you find interesting.

Using what you have learnt about HTTP request and REST APIs, in today's project you will build a website that uses data from a public API.

For example, previously we create a rain alert app using a weather API. We also created an ISS tracker and looking into Bitcoin prices, all using a public API.

Today, you get to work on an API that you find interesting and build a service or website based on that API.

Here are some example APIs from the course

## My comments:


I appreciate the sample APIs.  I will probably use one of those.
I am using the sound affects API to get a list of sounds, and present their links.  However, I won't download at this time.
