# Overview

This is the day 83 assignment.
This day is meant to be part of a portfoloio.

_From the course:_

Using what you have learnt about web development, build your own portfolio website.

- This can be designed any way you want. It's the place to show off your skills and the things you've built.
- Take inspiration from other developers but try not to copy their designs. Because this is about showing off what you can do!
- Use what you've learnt from Day 65 and plan out your website. Think about design, UI, UX, colour schemes, fonts. Don't build the website for other people, build it to make yourself proud.
- If you want, deploy and host the website to share with other students so we can admire your hard work!

My comments:

- For this assignment, I'll start by deferring to my [github repositories](https://github.com/marcoman?tab=repositories).   I have forked dozens, and I loosely maintain several of my own.  I also happen to have a couple of private repositories for the work I do with Sport SenseSay.
