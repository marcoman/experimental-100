# Overview

This is the day 86 assignment.

## _From the course:_

A Tkinter GUI desktop application that tests your typing speed.

## My comments:

- See my activities for Days 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 34

For this application, I'm intending to display an application with a few screen elements.
- Text that states, "press the button to begin"
- Button that says either "Start" or "Stop"
- A text box with the words we're meant to type in.
- A text box with the words we typed in.
- A running counter of
    - Chars typed in
    - Words tyed in
    - Time
    - WPM
    - Errors


I have to create a WPM metric, or look it up.  I'm thinking of using an open-source list of words, perhaps 1000 word.  The "Start" button shows me about 15 of these words, which I'll need to type.  The formula may be a simple as

```
(number of characters typed correctly - number of characters tped incorrectly) (60)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(# characters in a word, perhaps 6) (number of elapsed seconds)
```
