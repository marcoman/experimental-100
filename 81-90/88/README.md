# Overview

This is the day 88 assignment.

## _From the course:_

Build a website that lists cafes with wifi and power for remote working.

## My comments:

I can re-use the webiste from a previous assignment : Day 66 where we built a restful API to get details from our local data store, which was a sqlite db.
