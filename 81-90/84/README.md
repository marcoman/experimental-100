# Overview

This is the day 84 assignment.
The goal is to build a text-based tic-tac-toe game

_From the course:_

Using what you have learnt about Python programming, you will build a text-based version of the Tic Tac Toe game. The game should be playable in the command line just like the Blackjack game we created on Day 11. It should be a 2-player game, where one person is "X" and the other plays "O".


My comments:
