# This is the first problem in the 100 days of coding challenge series.  Specifically for python
# this problem is about asking you for your home town, and your pet's name, and the output is a concatenation as a band name.

# This code should output:
### Day 1 - Python Print Function
###         The function is declared like this:
###         print('what to print')
###         print ("This is Day 1")
town = input("Enter the name of your home town: ")
pet = input("Enter the name of your pet: ")

print(f"Your band name is: {town} {pet}")
