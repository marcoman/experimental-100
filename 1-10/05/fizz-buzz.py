# You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game.

# Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.

# When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".

# When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".`

#   And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"

smallest = int(input("Enter the smallest number: "))
largest = int(input("Enter the largest number: "))

for i in range(smallest, largest + 1):
