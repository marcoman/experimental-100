# Overview

This is a capstone project. We'll modify an existing project and add Bootstrap.  

We start by navigating to the https://startbootstrap.com/previews/clean-blog example, and download the template.  This is in our directory here as (upgraded-blog)[upgraded-blog].

# How to run
In the upgraded-blog folder, run the main.py via flask:

```bash
flask --app main run --debug
```
