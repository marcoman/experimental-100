# Introduction
This project is a continuation from the previous assignment, and has this guidance:

HTML Forms in Flask
So the goal for today is to understand how HTML forms are submitted and how to use the data from the form to actually send an email to ourselves with the data submitted by the user.

# How to run

`flask --app main --debug run` 


# Final task
The final task is to add the form-entry logic to our previous blog post.  This example uses a reference implementation and we update the file `main.py` to include a new `form-entry` app.route.

# Email
For these assignments, I don't send email because I don't want to add logic here that may reveal my server, etc.  I have been able to send email before, and see the exercise as "doing it again."
