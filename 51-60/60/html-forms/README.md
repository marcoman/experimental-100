# Introduction
This project is a continuation from the previous assignment, and has this guidance:

HTML Forms in Flask
So the goal for today is to understand how HTML forms are submitted and how to use the data from the form to actually send an email to ourselves with the data submitted by the user.

# How to run

`flask --app main --debug run`
